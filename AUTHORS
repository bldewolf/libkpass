The KeePass project, as well as the KeePassX project, have been significant
resources, both in design documents and as reference implementations.
DbFormat.txt is from the KeePass project and is included as a reference (it was
not specifically licensed and can be removed on request).

Thanks to nettle for doing the cryptographic dirty work for me (thanks to
OpenSSL for doing the dirty work for me previously, but no thanks for the
licensing issues).

The byte swapping functions are copies of the GNU C Library's htonl and htons
functions, with the affect reversed to achieve a host-to-little-endian
function.
